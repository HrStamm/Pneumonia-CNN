# Pneumonia-CNN

Pneumonia is a significant global health challenge, particularly for young children, em-
phasizing the importance of swift and accurate diagnosis. This study investigates the
effectiveness of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying pneumonia in chest
X-ray images compared to non-specialist medical professionals. The CNN architecture
was trained using a publicly available dataset of 5,116 chest X-ray images. We compared
two training distributions (73/27 and 50/50) to evaluate their effect on model perfor-
mance. The final model trained on the 73/27 distribution achieved highest accuracy but
showed a bias toward detecting pneumonia.
The model achieved a test accuracy of 96.08% (±1.57), significantly outperforming the
medical professionals accuracies of 67% and 70% (± around 9). These findings highlight
the potential of CNNs to enhance diagnostic precision and efficiency in clinical settings.
However, ethical concerns, including, bias in training data, and the necessity of clini-
cal oversight, must be addressed before widespread implementation. The study further
concludes that CNNs, when used with properly trained practitioners, can enhance di-
agnostics, reduce reliance on radiologists, and significantly benefit the medical industry
while retaining the importance of human expertise.
